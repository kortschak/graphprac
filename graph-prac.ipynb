    "# Graphical analysis of protein interactions in yeast\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this practical is to examine some uses of graphical analysis in a biological setting. The analyses are identical to those demonstrated in the London Tube Graph examples in the introduction to systems biology lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches we saw in the London Tube Map example involved visual examination of the coloured nodes and edges of the graph. For large biological (or other) graphs, this is not feasible. The graph we will be looking at today is shown here.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical uses the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). Go is a statically typed, compiled language, but we will be using it through an interactive environment called Jupyter. This tries to make Go behave as an interpretted language, and this may cause some problems at some stages. If you have any problems, please ask the demonstrators for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the package imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Go modularises code into packages (much the same way as other languages, though diffferent languages will use different terms for the same concept). Go packages must be imported before they can be used. In a compiled Go program this *must* happen at the beginning of a source code file, though in jupyter, this is not strictly necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The packages that we will use are for printing, `\"fmt\"`, logging errors, `\"log\"`, and performing the graph analyses, `\"github.com/kortschak/graphprac\"`. The first two packages are provided with the language and the last is a small package that wraps graph routines made available through the graph packages of the https://gonum.org project, [`graph/...`](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph/)."
